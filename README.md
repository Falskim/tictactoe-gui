# tictactoe-gui
GUI version of Tic Tac Toe using java.swing

Actually this game was created 1 year ago since the repo was created,
but because i just started to learn using git, so i upload it just now.

I using Netbeans to help designing the layout of the game (Thanks to drag 'n drop).
Since its it's the first time i used it, i still don't quite
understand what the difference between java form and panel, then i choose java frame instead.

I realize that are so many bug in this version, and 'maybe' i'm gonna fix it later lol
